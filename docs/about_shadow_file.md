 The /etc/shadow file stores actual password in encrypted format (more like the hash of the password) for userâ€™s account with additional properties related to user password. Basically, it stores secure user account information. All fields are separated by a colon (:) symbol. It contains one entry per line for each user listed in /etc/passwd file. 

 Example:


    ram     :  $6$i8KPmhNu.. :  17703  :  0  :  99999  :  7  :   :   :
    |---1---|--2-------------|---3-----|-4---|----5----|-6---| 8 | 9 |


1 - Username
2 - Encrypted Password
3 - Last password change (lastchanged) : Days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last changed
4 - Minimum : The minimum number of days required between password changes i.e. the number of days left before the user is allowed to change his/her password
5 - Maximum : The maximum number of days the password is valid (after that user is forced to change his/her password)
6 - Warn : The number of days before password is to expire that user is warned that his/her password must be changed
7 - Inactive : The number of days after password expires that account is disabled
8 - Expire : days since Jan 1, 1970 that account is disabled i.e. an absolute date specifying when the login may no longer be used.

To change password aging the command used is **chage**

### Checking integrity of the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow

Use the **pwck** command verifies the integrity of the users and authentication information. It checks that all entries in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow have the proper format and contain valid data. The user is prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted or which have other uncorrectable errors. The syntax is:

```
pwck -r /etc/passwd
pwck -r /etc/shadow
```

The above commands displays the warning and errors.
